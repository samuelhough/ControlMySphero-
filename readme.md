#Control My Sphero

A webservice for controlling my Sphero Robot across the web using the node-sphero-sdk, socket.io, and socket-client.

Currently I am successfully able to control the Sphero across the web.  I am now working on making the UI more intuitive before I do any public showcases of the project.
